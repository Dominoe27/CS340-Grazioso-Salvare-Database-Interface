How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Writing clean and modular code is essential for long-term maintainability. I reused the CRUD module I created in Project One to connect the dashboard to the MongoDB database. By keeping this module focused solely on database operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), I was able to separate the data logic from the visualization code. This made the dashboard code easier to read and update, and it kept functionality organized. This approach also makes the module reusable in future projects; whether for batch data processing, reporting tools, or administrative interfaces.
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I begin by analyzing the requirements and breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts. For Grazioso Salvareâ€™s dashboard, I first ensured database connectivity and then incrementally built out the interactive UI features. Compared to earlier courses, this project required deeper integration of back-end and front-end logic. Going forward, I would continue using modular CRUD classes and start with data validation and schema planning early to ensure scalability for different client use cases.
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve real-world problems by designing systems that manage, process, and visualize data efficiently. In this project, I created a tool that allows Grazioso Salvare to easily filter and analyze animals by rescue type and location. This dashboard helps end users act faster and more effectively, which is critical in time sensitive rescue scenarios. Projects like this demonstrate how software can directly impact operational efficiency and contribute to a mission driven organization.
